# Pixelvex-MonoGame-Resources
A collection of source code for a few 3D techniques, specifically for MonoGame.

ParticleEffect.fx: a modified version of Microsoft's 3D particle sample to make the shader work with MonoGame. Adds soft particles and some options for color and rotation over time. Also includes the modified ParticleVertex declaration that goes with it.
